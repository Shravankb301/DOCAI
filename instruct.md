# Detailed Implementation Plan for AI-Enabled Compliance System

## App Details

### Application Purpose
This system functions as an AI-enabled compliance checker that:
- Allows users to upload regulatory documents
- Analyzes document text for compliance issues using transformer models
- Categorizes documents as "compliant" or "non-compliant"
- Stores analysis results in a database for audit and reference
- Provides confidence scores for compliance determinations

### Technical Architecture

1. **Backend (FastAPI)**
   - REST API with endpoints for file upload and document analysis
   - Transformer-based AI model using zero-shot classification
   - File validation and secure storage
   - Integration with Supabase for persistent storage
   - Background task processing for handling long-running analyses

2. **Frontend (Next.js)**
   - Simple, intuitive user interface for document submission
   - File upload functionality with status indicators
   - Text input area for document content
   - Analysis results display with compliance status and confidence scores
   - Responsive design for desktop and mobile use

3. **Database (Supabase)**
   - `risks` table with the following structure:
     - `id`: Unique identifier (SERIAL PRIMARY KEY)
     - `file_path`: Path to the uploaded document
     - `status`: Compliance status ("compliant" or "non-compliant")
     - `details`: Additional analysis information
     - `created_at`: Timestamp of the analysis

4. **AI Model**
   - Uses Hugging Face's transformers library
   - Leverages the `facebook/bart-large-mnli` model for zero-shot classification
   - Categorizes text against predefined compliance labels
   - Returns confidence scores for classification decisions

## Phase 1: Environment Setup (Day 1)

1. **Set up local development environment**
   - Install required tools: Node.js (v14+), Python 3.8+, Docker, Docker Compose, Git
   - Clone/create a new repository for the project
   - Create the project structure as outlined in the document

2. **Configure version control**

   - Test text input and analysis submission
   - Verify results are displayed correctly

## Phase 4: Supabase Integration (Day 6)

1. **Create Supabase project**
   - Sign up/login to Supabase
   - Create a new project
   - Obtain and securely store project URL and API keys

2. **Configure database**
   - Execute SQL commands to create necessary tables
   - Set up appropriate permissions
   - Test connection from both backend and frontend

3. **Implement authentication (optional)**
   - Configure authentication providers if needed
   - Implement login/registration functionality
   - Set up proper security roles and policies

## Phase 5: Docker Configuration (Day 7)

1. **Create Dockerfiles**
   - Implement backend Dockerfile
   - Implement frontend Dockerfile
   - Configure appropriate base images and dependencies

2. **Set up Docker Compose**
   - Create docker-compose.yml file
   - Configure environment variables
   - Set up networking between services

3. **Test containerized application**
   - Build and run containers
   - Verify services can communicate with each other
   - Confirm connection to Supabase works correctly

## Phase 6: Testing and Quality Assurance (Days 8-9)

1. **Set up automated testing**
   - Configure pytest for backend testing
   - Set up Jest and React Testing Library for frontend
   - Create basic test suites for critical functionality

2. **Implement code quality tools**
   - Configure linters and formatters
   - Set up pre-commit hooks
   - Implement continuous integration workflow (GitHub Actions)

3. **Perform manual testing**
   - Test the complete user flow from upload to analysis
   - Verify data is correctly stored in Supabase
   - Check for edge cases and error handling

## Phase 7: Deployment and Documentation (Day 10)
